I worked as a *web developer* (Nokia Siemens Networks, IBM) and a *data analyst* ([Beijing Si-Tech](http://www.si-tech.com.cn)).

Currently I am a master student at [TU-Clausthal](http://www.tu-clausthal.de/) and [Uni-Goettingen](http://www.uni-goettingen.de/) in Germany.

I am focus on *Web Development* (**Java**) and *Data Mining* (**Ruby** & **R**). And I also doing something about **Database** and **Android**.

You can view my projects in the Projects page or in my GitHub.

I am crazy at soccer, and interested in travelling at any given (and non-given) moment, reading books, and making new friends :)

Feel free to contact to me.
