I worked as a *Software Engineer* (Nokia Siemens Networks, Si-Tech, IBM) and as a *Data Scientist* ([Beijing Si-Tech](http://www.si-tech.com.cn){:target="_blank"}). Now, I am working for [OCLC](https://www.oclc.org/){:target="_blank"}.

I got my master degree at [TU-Clausthal](http://www.tu-clausthal.de/){:target="_blank"} in Germany.

I am an experienced software engineer with over 10 years of work in Germany and China, focusing on full‑stack development, distributed systems, and modern web technologies. My main tech stack includes **Java**, **JavaScript/TypeScript**, **React**, **Spring Boot**, and **PL/SQL**, and I also have experience with databases and data‑intensive applications.

You can view my projects in the [Projects]({{ site.url }}/projects) page or on my [GitHub](https://github.com/sampig){:target="_blank"}.

Outside of work, I am passionate about football, reading, movies, music, and traveling, and I always enjoy learning new things and meeting new people.

Feel free to contact to me.
