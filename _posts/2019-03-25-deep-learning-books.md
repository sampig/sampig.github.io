## Deep Learning

[Deep Learning](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/){:target="_blank"}: An MIT Press book

Authors: Ian Goodfellow and Yoshua Bengio and Aaron Courville.

This book is considered to the "Bible" of Deep Learning and recommended by a lot of people.
"_It is a resource intended to help students and practitioners enter the field of machine learning in general and deep learning in particular._"

We could get the online of the book including its lectures, exercises and other resources.
